# The Zoo
This was a school assignment where we were given an API endpoint consisting of an array with different animal objects. We were instructed to display them and create a way to manage their feeding schedule according to the criterias listed further down.

## Criterias for the assignment
#### For passing:
☑️ Create a Single Page Application (SPA) (in React with TypeScript) that includes a homepage where animals are presented with names and brief descriptions. 

☑️  It should be possible to click on an animal to view more information about it through a separate route. 

☑️ From the animal's individual page, you should be able to mark whether the animal has been fed using a button named "Feed Animal." 

☑️ When you click this button, the animal's status should change to indicate that it has been fed, and the button should no longer be clickable. 

☑️ You also need to include the time the animal was fed.

#### For extra credit:

☑️  When you visit the animal's page again, check if it has been more than three hours since the last feeding. If this is the case, the feeding status is reset, and it should be possible to feed the animal again. 

☑️ For an extra challenge, you should display a small notice on the homepage as well as on the animal's page, indicating that an animal needs to be fed if more than four hours have passed since it was last fed.
